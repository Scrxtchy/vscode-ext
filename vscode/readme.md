A few weeks ago I while going through Visual Studio Code's source, I stumbled across an extention gallery support before any proper announcement.
I built this page to list all extentions outside of the application.
Any improvements can be PR'd, I really don't care.
api version may need to be increased every few months I guess

How 2 install:  
see this nice page  
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/install-extension  
tl;dr
```
code myExtensionFolder\myExtension.vsix
```
alternatively, they can be opened with 7zip or something

HOW IT WORKS

A few weeks ago I while going through Visual Studio Code's source, I stumbled across an extention gallery support before any proper announcement.
I built this page to list all extentions outside of the application.
Any improvements can be PR'd, I really don't care.
api version may need to be increased every few months I guess

HOW IT WORKS

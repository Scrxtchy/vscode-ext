This is a project I orignally did back in 2015. After """"Reverse Engineering"""" the then *closed source* visual studio code and finding a in preview extension gallery. It was a task to be able to put these preview extensions into a public gallery, before microsoft had even announced the thing.

Even moreso, I contributed [these lines of code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-MDTools/blob/master/extension.ts#L136-L138) to an extension as a joke (and as improvement I wanted), while knowing full well I'm not in the preview program. 

Projects pretty much dead and I don't care about it, but I'm archiving it today so like whatever
